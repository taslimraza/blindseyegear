# blindseyegear

I am introducing this device to help blind people while they are outside on the way/ they are at home. 

This device can detect any obstacle in front of this device and it can play a beep warning sound so that person can know that some sort of obstacle is there and they can change there way and keep themselves safe from any sort of accident.
